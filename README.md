# 🛡️ Wi-Fi Intrusion Detection System (WIDS)

A simple and lightweight **Wi-Fi Intrusion Detection System** built using Python and Npcap.  
This tool analyzes nearby Wi-Fi activity, monitors packets, and detects suspicious behaviors such as:

- Deauthentication attacks  
- Unknown MAC addresses  
- Rapid probe requests  
- Packet floods  
- Sudden disconnect patterns  
- Abnormal wireless traffic

This project was developed as part of a cybersecurity learning initiative and is intended for educational and defensive purposes only.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time Wi-Fi packet monitoring  
- Detects common wireless-based attacks  
- Logs all alerts to the `logs/` folder  
- Easy to use Python script (`test_wids.py`)  
- Includes a compiled Windows executable (`WIDS.exe`)  
- Works on any Windows system with **Npcap** installed

## 🧰 Requirements

Before running the script or EXE, install:

### ✔️ **Npcap (Packet Capture Driver)**
Download included installer:

```
npcap-1.84.exe
```

OR download from:  
https://nmap.org/npcap/

Make sure to enable:

- “WinPcap API-compatible mode” (if available)

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Python Script

### 1️⃣ Install Python modules
```
pip install scapy
pip install pyinstaller   # (Only needed if you want to rebuild the EXE)
```

### 2️⃣ Run the program
```
python test_wids.py
```

The tool will begin capturing nearby Wi-Fi traffic and display alerts in the console.

---

## ▶️ How to Run the EXE (No Python Needed)

Simply double-click:

```
WIDS.exe
```

or run from command line:

```
.\WIDS.exe
```

Npcap **must** be installed for packet capture to work.

---

## 📜 Logs

All detected events are stored in:

```
logs/
```

Each log entry includes:

- Timestamp  
- Event type  
- Source MAC  
- Description of behavior  

This makes it easy to review past wireless activity.

---

## 🛠️ Building the EXE (Optional)

If you want to regenerate the executable:

```
pyinstaller test_wids.spec
```

The output will appear in:

```
dist/WIDS.exe
```
